<h1>Pyternary</h1>
<h5>There is a Computation Engine called Deternary, which is a really impressive program. However, it lacks the ability to save your code, and also is a lot more confusing to enter your code. Because
    of these issues, I created Pyternary, which is a Python based interpretor that allows you to program outside of the computation engine. It will then import the code for you. This entire project took roughly 3-6 hours.

<h1>Conways Game of Life</h1>
<h5>Conways Game of Life is a really cool programming thing. Back in Freshmen year, we were tasked with using AI to create a website, so I created a Conways Game of Life website. 
            Later on in school, I was tasked with creating a website, in which I created EvanGAMES, a website containing various games. One of the games that I created was Conways Game of Life. I am
            incredibly happy to have been able to make it without AI, as it proves to myself that I am improving at various Website developers. The most of the code is within the Javascript, which is my 
            personal favorite language of the group of HTML, CSS, and JS. This entire project took roughly 5 total days.</h5>
